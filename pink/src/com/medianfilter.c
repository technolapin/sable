\brief median filter 

<B>Usage:</B> medianfilter in.pgm el.pgm out.pgm

<B>Description:</B>
Let F be the input image, G be the output image, and E the structuring
element. 
then for each pixel p, G[p] is the median element of the sorted list (by 
increasing order) of the pixel values in the set { F[q], q in E[p] }.

The median filter is a particular case of rank filter (see rankfilter.c), 
with rank = 0.5 .

<B>Types supported:</B> byte 2d, byte 3d

<B>Category:</B> morpho
\ingroup morpho
